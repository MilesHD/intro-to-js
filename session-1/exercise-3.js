// Exercise 3: Pseudoclassical Pattern

// 1. Create an Pet constructor function that takes a name and type. Create a method named "speak" and console.log a funny greeting with the pets name.

// Your Code Here

// 2. Instantiate 2 pets, and have each of them "speak"

// Your Code Here

// Verify
pet1.speak(); // Hello there Chaps! My name is Bubbles
pet2.speak(); // Hello there Chaps! My name is Sparky
