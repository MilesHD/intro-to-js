## Introduction

### About Me

Hello everyone, and welcome to "Introduction to JavaScript", or alternately titled "How I learned to Stop Worrying and Love the JavaScript." This is the first of our four sessions together, so you might as well get to know me a little better. My name is Miles Dickinson, and my first introduction to JavaScript was when I started developing websites as a sophmore in high school, and I probably couldn't have had a rockier introduction to programming or the language. I had little to no clue what I was doing, and blindly copied and pasted from online, just trying to get my code to work. Needless to say, failure was the norm and thankfully my passion helped me push through those years of frustration. My fundamental mistake was trying to use the language without understanding it. That mistake, however, is not only made by technically uneducated teenagers, it's made by many professionals and is the core reason for any negative connotations you may have or have heard about the language.

JavaScript is famous for both being the world's most misunderstood programming language, and having more good parts and bad parts than any other language. My hope is by the end of this class you'll have a healthy perspective on the language in how you can write expressive, powerful, and secure programs with the good parts, and eliminate the bad parts by simply not using them.

### My Mentors

I want to take a minute and introduce some of my mentors over the years. There are many more smaller, and anonymous contributors to my knowledge and development, but these three: Douglas Crockford, Kyle Simpson, and Dr. Axel Rauschmayer, have been by far the most significant. They're incredibly smart people, and have given enormously to the community in terms of education, open source development, and trailblazing the future of the language. I highly recommend you look them up and check out their collective works to take your JavaScirpt and programming to the next level.

### Course Outline and Goals

The hardest thing about putting this class together was trying to scope it down to four hours. We could have a two-day workshop and still not cover everything I would like to discuss, but unfortunately none of us have the time for that. I want you to leave this class as a tangibly better programmer and with a broad understanding of what JavaScript is, how to effectively use it, and where to go next.

Today we're going to discuss the What JavaScript is, is not, and why we should care about. Then we'll get into the language fundamentals including types, variables, and control flow, Followed by an introduction to functions and scope, and wrap up with a look at the JavaScript's prototypal object system.
